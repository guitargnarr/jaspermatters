â–¡ A record @ â†’ 18.208.88.157 (Netlify)

## After DNS Update:
â–¡ Wait 2-3 minutes
â–¡ Go to GitHub Pages settings
â–¡ Click "Check again" next to DNS error
â–¡ Wait for "DNS check successful" âœ…
â–¡ Enable "Enforce HTTPS"
â–¡ Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

## Verify It's Working:
```bash
# Run this command to check DNS
nslookup jaspermatters.com

# Should show:
# 185.199.108.153
# 185.199.109.153
# 185.199.110.153
# 185.199.111.153

# Test the site (after 10 minutes)
open https://jaspermatters.com
```

## Timeline:
- DNS update in GoDaddy: 2 minutes
- DNS propagation: 5-15 minutes
- GitHub verification: 2-3 minutes
- Site deployment: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: ~15-30 minutes**

## Troubleshooting:

**If DNS check still fails after 15 minutes:**
- Make sure you deleted ALL old A records
- Verify all 4 GitHub IPs are added
- Clear browser cache and try again

**If site shows 404:**
- DNS is working but GitHub Pages needs more time
- Check: https://github.com/guitargnar/jaspermatters-job-intelligence/actions
- Look for green checkmark on "pages build and deployment"

**If still showing OurJourney:**
- DNS hasn't propagated yet
- Try incognito/private browser mode
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
