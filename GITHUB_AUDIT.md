# GitHub Profile & Repository Audit

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues to Fix

### Profile Issues
1. **Name**: Shows as "guitargnar" instead of "Matthew Scott"
2. **Bio**: "Thanks, I like to make things" - too casual for $200K roles
3. **No company**: Missing current status (e.g., "Open to opportunities")
4. **No website/blog**: jaspermatters.com not linked
5. **Low follower count**: 2 followers (network signal)

### Repository Issues
1. **Many forked repos**: Dilutes your original work
2. **Guitar/music repos**: Mixed with tech (FretVision, enhanced-chord-generator)
3. **No pinned repositories**: Not showcasing best work
4. **Inconsistent descriptions**: Some repos have no descriptions
5. **No unified brand**: Mix of personal/professional projects
