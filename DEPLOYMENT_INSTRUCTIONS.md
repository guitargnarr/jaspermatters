# ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions for jaspermatters.com

## Your Job Intelligence Platform is Ready!

The code is pushed to GitHub. Now complete these steps to make it live at jaspermatters.com:

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/guitargnar/jaspermatters-job-intelligence/settings
2. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
3. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Deploy from a branch**
4. Under **Branch**, select:
   - Branch: `main` 
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**

## Step 2: Configure Custom Domain (5 minutes)

### In GitHub:
1. Still in the Pages settings
2. Under **Custom domain**, enter: `jaspermatters.com`
3. Click **Save**
4. Check **Enforce HTTPS** (may take a few minutes to become available)

### At Your Domain Registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):

Add these DNS records:

```
Type    Name    Value
A       @       185.199.108.153
A       @       185.199.109.153
A       @       185.199.110.153
A       @       185.199.111.153
CNAME   www     guitargnar.github.io
```

Remove any existing A records pointing elsewhere.

## Step 3: Verify Deployment (10-20 minutes for DNS)

1. Check deployment status: https://github.com/guitargnar/jaspermatters-job-intelligence/actions
2. Once DNS propagates, visit: https://jaspermatters.com
3. Test the live demos in the terminal
4. Check that resume page works: https://jaspermatters.com/resume.html
