# ðŸš¨ DNS FIX REQUIRED - jaspermatters.com

## The Problem
Your domain is currently pointing to Vercel (OurJourney app), not GitHub Pages.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Option 1: Remove from Vercel (FASTEST - 5 minutes)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find the OurJourney project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Domains
4. Remove `jaspermatters.com`
5. This will free up the domain immediately

### Option 2: Update DNS at Your Registrar (10-30 minutes)
Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):

1. **DELETE these records** (if they exist):
   - Any CNAME pointing to `vercel.app` or `vercel-dns.com`
   - Any A records NOT pointing to GitHub's IPs

2. **ADD these records**:
   ```
   Type    Host    Value
   A       @       185.199.108.153
   A       @       185.199.109.153
   A       @       185.199.110.153
   A       @       185.199.111.153
   CNAME   www     guitargnarr.github.io
   ```

### After DNS Update:

1. **In GitHub Pages settings** (where you are now):
   - Click the "Check again" button next to the DNS error
   - If DNS is correct, it will turn green âœ…

2. **Once DNS check passes**:
   - The site will automatically deploy
   - HTTPS will become available
   - Your ML platform will be live!

## Quick DNS Check Commands

```bash
# Check current DNS (should show GitHub IPs)
nslookup jaspermatters.com

# Check CNAME (should show guitargnarr.github.io)
nslookup www.jaspermatters.com

# If you see Vercel IPs (76.76.21.21 or similar), DNS needs updating
```

## Timeline
- Vercel removal: Instant
- DNS propagation: 10-30 minutes
- GitHub Pages deployment: 5 minutes after DNS is fixed

## Success Indicators
âœ… GitHub Pages shows "âœ… DNS check successful"
âœ… "Enforce HTTPS" becomes available
âœ… jaspermatters.com shows your ML platform (not OurJourney)
