# ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your domain jaspermatters.com is working but showing old content. Follow these steps NOW:

## üî¥ Step 1: GitHub Pages Settings (DO THIS FIRST)

The browser should already be open at the settings page. If not, go to:
**https://github.com/guitargnar/jaspermatters-job-intelligence/settings/pages**

### Configure these settings:

1. **Source**: Select `Deploy from a branch`
2. **Branch**: Select `main` 
3. **Folder**: Select `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**

5. **Custom domain**: Enter `jaspermatters.com`
6. Click **Save**

7. Wait 1 minute, then check ‚úÖ **Enforce HTTPS**

## üü° Step 2: Verify Deployment (2-10 minutes)

Visit: **https://github.com/guitargnar/jaspermatters-job-intelligence/actions**

You should see a workflow running called "pages build and deployment"

## üü¢ Step 3: Test Your New Site

Once the workflow completes (green checkmark), visit:

1. **https://jaspermatters.com** - Should show your ML platform
2. **https://jaspermatters.com/resume.html** - Should show your resume

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- GitHub Pages setup: 2 minutes
- Build and deployment: 5-10 minutes  
- Site goes live: 10-15 minutes total

## üö® If Still Showing Old Content After 15 Minutes:

1. Clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check: https://guitargnar.github.io/jaspermatters-job-intelligence
   - If this works, DNS just needs more time
   - If this doesn't work, GitHub Pages needs configuration

## ‚úÖ You'll Know It's Working When:

- Landing page shows "AI/ML Engineer & Architect"
- You see the purple gradient header
- The interactive terminal is visible
- Your metrics (79+ models, $1.2M value) are displayed
